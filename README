This is a sneak peek of my minimal PS3 FTP server written with the help of PSL1GHT

1) to start the FTP server, just run the ps3ftp.fself via ps3load/wiiload or install the 
   ps3ftp.pkg and run it directly on your PS3.

2) usage: I have mainly developed this while testing it with Filezilla, if it works with other
   FTP clients that's fine, but if it doesn't work don't blame me.
   Up to now the FTP server is just single-thread/single-connection, so before you can connect
   to the server again, you have to close any previous connection. This also means that you
   have to configure Filezilla to use only one FTP connection at a time (you can configure this
   in Filezillas server options).

3) To stop the server once it is running, you have to close the FTP connection to it from your
   FTP client then connect to the FTP port (21) of your PS3 via telnet and type "QUIT!".
   If you are running Unix and have the "expect" interpreter installed, you can use the "stop"
   script that is located at the repository's root directory.
